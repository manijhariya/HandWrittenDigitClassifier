# InternProject
Hand Digit Recognition ML project impliment in Tensorflow(Python)

It uses the Tensorflow framework and MNIST Datasets to overcome the complexity of the
ML projects it has upload features to upload image than it is going to predict about that
image. 

### Directories Structure
- ***           /app.py to implement server to upload the file
- *** templete  html file template
- ***           /predict.py which is going to predict about model
- ***           /train-model.py to create the model..
